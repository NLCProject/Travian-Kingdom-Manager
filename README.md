# Travian-Kingdom-Manager
Travian Kingdom Manager is an Open-Source Bot to semi-automatize any Travian Kingdoms Account (https://www.kingdoms.com/) and to provide a (for now) basic but fully functional responsive UI layout for desktop and mobile devices, which isn't provided by the official makers of the game.
